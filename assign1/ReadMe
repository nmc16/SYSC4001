The project consists of 4 files: controller.c, cloud.c, sensor.c, actuator.c.

Each file can be closed gracefully using Control + C on the command line.

The project can be built running 'make' using the Makefile in the directory:

    ie:
        $cd assign1/
        $make

Cloud:
    The cloud is the first process that should be run. It will act as the server
     side of the FIFO. The FIFO will be created under /tmp/. The cloud.c file does 
     not require any arguments.
    
        ie:
            $./cloud

Controller:
    The controller is the next process that should be run. It requires one argument
     and that is the message queue path. This path must be the same for all files
     to connect to the same message queue. The controller's parent will only start
     monitoring after Control + C is pressed.
     
        ie:
            $./controller message_queue_path
            
Actuator:
    The actuator handles the alarms generated by the controller. It will print the 
     alarm data with the action sent from the controller. It requires 3 arguments:
     Path for Message Queue, Actuator Type, and Name. 
     
    The actuator type must be either 'bell' that corresponds to a smoke sensor, 
     or 'ac' that corresponds to a temperature sensor.
     
        ie:
            $./actuator message_queue_path ac|bell actuator_name
            
Sensor:
    The sensor reads random data and sends to the controller. It requires 4 arguments:
     Path for Message Queue, Sensor type, Name, and Threshold. 
     
    The sensor type must be either 'temp' or 'temperature' for a temperature sensor or
     'smoke' for a smoke sensor. Both types read random data and generate alarms 
     if the data crosses the threshold.
     
        ie:
            $./sensor message_queue_path temp|temperature|smoke sensor_name 100
