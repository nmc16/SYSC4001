The project consists of 2 files main files: producer and consumer.
  Also contains two files: producer_without_sem and consumer_without_sem that 
  are copies of the above two files without Semaphore S to show that it is
  not needed for one consumer and one producer.
  
The text file text.txt was used for testing.
  
The project can be built running 'make' using the Makefule in the directory:

    ie:
        $cd assign2/
        $make
     
Consumer:
    Consumer is the first program that should be run. It will consume the buffers
    produced by the producer into a file using redirection. Otherwise all the 
    text will be printed to stdout. The consumer can be closed gracefully using
    Control+C. To run it so the output goes to a file:
    
        $./consumer > output.txt
        
Producer:
    Producer produces the text to shared memory given an input file through
    redirection. The producer can be closed gracefully using Control+C.
    Running the producer:
        
        $./producer < input.txt

Producer and Consumer without Semaphore S:
    These files should only be run with one consumer then one producer using the same
    method as above.
